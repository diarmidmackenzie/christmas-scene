# christmas-scene
For Christmas 2021, I'm building a Winter Wonderland in VR.

My plan is to add something new every day, for each day of advent 2021.  It might be a new object in the scene, some improvement to something I already added, or some other new functionality.

You can experience the Winter Wonderland yourself here:

Best experienced on the Oculus Quest 2, but may work on other VR headsets as well, and it can also be viewed (but with limited functionality) on any browser.

### Development Log

Here's the features I have added so far.

**3 December**

(starting 2 days late, so I added 3 things today!)

- Basic winter environment
- Made it snow!
- Added basic snowman with eyes, mouth, nose, hat and arms.

**4 December**

- Grab and reposition snowman's face & arms.

**5 December**

- Retain objects' rotation & velocity on release - allows throwing of objects, juggling etc.

**6 December**

- Added Christmas tree with multi-colour baubles, which show reflections of the environment.

**7 December**

- Replaced the snowman's broomstick arms with more organic-looking sticks.  Also gave him a new hat, which can be moved about.

**8 December**

- Added a xylophone made of icicles.  This can be played with your hands, or using one of the snowman's arms as a atick.
